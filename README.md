# Summary: 
This repository contains source code and notes as I've been walking myself through the ros2 tutorials on docs.ros.org
These notes are specific to the ros2 humble hawksbill distro -- a future task will be to try to build these packages in jazzy jalisco or the latest at the time

That is all for now -- more to come (and hopefully a more interesting project in the next repo :)
